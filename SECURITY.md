# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Only the latest `main` and latest tagged release are supported for security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do not open a public issue for unpatched vulnerabilities.

Instead:
- Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting (if enabled), or
- Contact maintainers privately with:
  - Impact summary
  - Reproduction details
  - Suggested mitigation (if any)

We aim to acknowledge reports within 72 hours.
